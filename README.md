# ![](favicon.ico) The Merlin JS framework
 - No building tools. Use a regular html file as a Single File Component.
 - Server side rendered by default
([templates](https://marcodpt.github.io/tint/syntax/intro.html) are valid html).
 - Ridiculously small API. After reading this file you will understand `Merlin`
better than me.
 - Ultrafast [vDom](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/superfine).
 - Built-in Single Page Application Router.

  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>To do list</h1>
      <input type="text" value:="value" data-oninput="NewValue">
      <ul>
        <li each:="todos" text:></li>
      </ul>
      <button data-onclick="AddTodo">New!</button>
    </main>
    <script type="module">
      import merlin from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marcodpt/merlin/index.js"

      merlin({
        components: {
          todo: {
            root: document.body.querySelector('main'),
            init: () => ({
              value: "",
              todos: []
            }),
            AddTodo: ({todos, value}) => ({
              todos: todos.concat(value),
              value: ''
            }),
            NewValue: ({todos, value}, ev) => ({
              todos,
              value: ev.target.value
            })
          }
        }
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you are using a template, you can write directly:

```html
<template id="my-view">
  <main>
    <h1>To do list</h1>
    <input type="text" value:="value" oninput="NewValue">
    <ul>
      <li each:="todos" text:></li>
    </ul>
    <button onclick="AddTodo">New!</button>
  </main>
<template>
```

Every `on{event}` or `data-on{event}` attribute will be treated as a string and
converted to the component's associated function.

If you are not using a `template` and the element is already SSR in the DOM you
MUST use `data-on{event}` because there is no global function `NewValue` or
`AddTodo` and it will result in errors.

# API
## merlin({components, root, routes, middleware, ...init}) -> stop

### components: {name: {root, template, init, done, format, ...methods}}
Array of static components that must be initialized at the start of routing.
Useful for navigation bars for example.
If not passed, the default value is an empty array.

### root: DOM Element
The DOM Element that the component should mount.
In the case of the `init` property, each entry has its own `root`.
In the case of the `root` property, it will be used in all routes from the
`routes` property.

### template: DOM Element
An optional DOM Element that must be passed with the element's view to be
mounted on `root`.
If not passed, `root` itself will be used as view.

### routes: [{route, template, controller}]
Array of routes for routing following the page `hash`.
If not passed, the default value is an empty array.
If `route` is not passed, the route will be called if no match happens.
If `template` is not passed, `root` will be used.
If `controller` is not passed a simple rendering will be done.

### route: string
Hash path of the route in question.
If you do not pass the `route` property, the route will be called if there is
no match.
You can declare parameters in routes, for example:
```js
{
  route: '#/counter/:count'
}
```

### middleware: [({url, path, query, route, Params, Query}) -> {...}]
Array of functions that add parameters associated with the page hash.
It should always return an object with new parameters.
If not passed, the default value is an empty array.
For example, if you declared the route:
```js
{
  route: '#/counter/:count'
}
```
And we have the hash of the page at that moment equal to:
```
#/counter/7?x=13&y=bird
```
We have:
```js
{
  url: '#/counter/7?x=13&y=bird',
  path: '#/counter/7',
  query: 'x=13&y=bird',
  route: '#/counter/:count',
  Params: {
    count: '7'
  },
  Query: {
    x: '13',
    y: 'bird'
  }
}
```
New properties can be added to be passed to all `controllers` using your owns
`middlewares`.

### controller: ({...middleware, root, refresh}) -> stop
Function that controls the component.
The properties generated by the `middlewares` are only available on the
`routes` property.
The `init` property your `controllers` will only have available:
`root`, `render`.

### refresh: () -> ()
Reinitializes the route by calling `controller` with the same parameters as
the current call.
          
### stop: () -> ()
Function that when called stops the component.

## Template engine
Merlin uses [Tint](https://github.com/marcodpt/tint) as its template engine,
you should read the [docs](https://marcodpt.github.io/tint/syntax/intro.html)
for a complete reference.

## Bundle
The `index.min.js` file is a minified and bundled version of `index.js` built
online with [bundle.js](https://bundlejs.com/).
