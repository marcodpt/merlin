## ‚ù§Ô∏è Features
 - No building tools.
 - Single HTML file by default.
 - Built by combining ideas from small modules following the
[UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
 - Pure functional ELM architecture state management
[library](https://github.com/marcodpt/ring).
 - Ultrafast [vDom](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/superfine).
 - Server side rendered by default
([templates](https://marcodpt.github.io/tint/syntax/intro.html) are valid html).
 - Built-in Single Page Application [Router](https://github.com/marcodpt/wand).
 - Ridiculously small API. After reading this file you will understand `Merlin`
better than me.

## üìñ API
`Merlin` uses [Tint](https://github.com/marcodpt/tint) as its template engine,
you should read the [docs](https://marcodpt.github.io/tint/syntax/intro.html)
for a complete reference.

### app({node, template?, view?, init, register}) => stop

#### node: DOM Node 
Where to mount the `app`.

#### template: Dom Node
An optional `template` to render, if nothing is passed the `node` itself will
be used.

#### view: (state, events) => data
Exactly as defined in [Ring](https://github.com/marcodpt/ring#-api).

The only exception is that it returns `data` that will be used for
[Tint](https://github.com/marcodpt/tint) to render the page,
if not passed the unmodified `state` will be returned to
[Tint](https://github.com/marcodpt/tint).

#### init
Exactly as defined in [Ring](https://github.com/marcodpt/ring#-api).

The initial `state` of the `app`. It can be any type of data.

#### register: (update, dispatch) => events
Exactly as defined in [Ring](https://github.com/marcodpt/ring#-api).

It is called before initializing the `app` returning the `registered`
`events`.

#### stop: () => ()
Exactly as defined in [Ring](https://github.com/marcodpt/ring#-api).

Returns a function that `stops` the `app`.

### spa({node, routes, plugins?}) => stop

#### node: DOM Node
Where to mount the `spa`.

#### routes: {route: {template?, init?, view?, register?}}

##### route: string
Exactly as defined in [Wand](https://github.com/marcodpt/wand#-api).

Accepts `*` to match any path and `:param` to declare variable.

##### template: Dom Node
A template to be rendered on the route, if nothing is passed it will use the
original content of the `node`.

##### init: routeData => state
An optional function that will be called every time the route is started,
returning the initial state. If not passed, `Params` from `routeData` will be
used as the initial `state`.

##### view, register
Exactly as defined in `app`

#### plugins: [routeData => ()]
Exactly as defined in [Wand](https://github.com/marcodpt/wand#-api).

An optional array of `plugins`, which are executed sequentially with each
`route` `change` and which can modify the `routeData`.

#### stop: () => ()
Exactly as defined in [Wand](https://github.com/marcodpt/wand#-api).

Returns a function that stops the `spa`.

#### routeData {url, route, path, Params, query, Query}
Exactly as defined in [Wand](https://github.com/marcodpt/wand#-api).

`Plugins` can introduce new properties or change existing ones.

##### url: string
The `url` as it was passed.

##### route: string
The `route` that matched as declared.

##### path: string
The part of the `url` before the `?`.

##### Params: object
Object containing the variables declared in the `route` with the associated
values in the current `path`.

##### query: string
The part of `url` after the `?`.

##### Query: object
Parsed query string.
